# Pandas Learning Project - Code With Harry

## Overview
This repository showcases my journey learning **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. I followed the [Pandas Tutorial - Learn Pandas in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9WGC0SLPVs) by Code With Harry to understand the basics and apply them in simple projects.

## What I Learned
Thanks to Code With Harryâ€™s video, I covered:
- Creating and using **Series** and **DataFrames**
- Loading data from CSV files
- Filtering, sorting, and cleaning data
- Basic operations like adding columns and handling missing values
- Real-world applications of Pandas for data analysis
